
Hello! I would like you to help me establish a Github repo for the Delphi Project in the current directory, called "Worlds."

Eventual Task End Goals: 
  1) establish repo for Worlds project
  2) enable Github Pages blog

Pertinent parameters for the task:
- I have a Git account, and Git is installed on this computer
- This is a Delphi project 
- I would like to use Github Pages to host a development blog (/blog folder)
- I would like a gitignore file appropriate for a Delphi project w/blog


## Steps for Copilot
- Please read this complete file and make sure it makes sense - I do not write perfect instructions, so if something seems illogical or unclear, please call it to my attention. Thank you!

- I have created a file called ai/copilot-github-plan.md for you
- I would like you to generate a step-by-step plan for getting this project under git
- Please include information about which steps you can do, and which steps I need to do
- You may create any files you deem necessary within the Worlds project folder
- You may ask for clarifications at any point you need

Once the plan has been generated into ai/copilot-github-plan.md, please stop there, and wait for me to review the plan, and ask questions about my parts.

Thank you!
