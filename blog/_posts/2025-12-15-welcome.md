# Intro

This project began life as a question ...

*Can "emergent properties" be witnessed in something a desktop PC can do, or is that an "at scale"  phenomenon?*

Well, it turns out that [*coming soon because that's what we're finding out here*]. I know, I was surprised, too!


## What Is Worlds?

Worlds is a simulator designed to give some critters every possible opportunity to show some emergent properties or behaviors ... or whatever because I am learning that these terms are open to quite a bit of interpretation.

So, it's a simulation engine. 

And a workbench on top to see into the engine and make it go.

But its *purpose* is to be coded upon, and experimented with, and marveled at. This is an engine, at the core, and it's *designed* to be upgraded with new smarts.

It's definitely code-first, and pixels second, and pragmatically. But, everything is replaceable or upgradable and introducing new systems should be very easy as well. That's the goal!

## The Role of AI in Worlds

In addition to writing an engine to investigate something I've never coded before (my solitaire solver project exists for the same reason) I also wanted to use Worlds to get more experience utilizing AI on a project. 

There's another post about my experiences and thoughts about AI in general, which exists so that I can come back to it after the robots have taken over, and see how blasphemous I was, and how worried I should be.

Anyway - AI and I converse in English, not code. It's not there yet, not for me, not for how I like to work or code. But I love using AI for discussions in English about architecture, approaches, different algorithms, etc. This is the sweet spot for me, where it's helpful.

But all of the code in Worlds was written by me. Read my Perlin Noise horror story for why :)
