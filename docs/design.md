## About

Worlds is a personal project that exists because:
- Curiosity: can emergent properties be witnessed at a desktop PC program scale?
- Exposure to Delphi's parallel library
- A completely new type of coding, for me, anyway
- Further experience with integrating AI into the project development process
- Create a framework that's easily extensible and fun to work in.
